property_value: http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/abstract "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common monogenic diseases in humans with multiple phenotypic expressions that can manifest as both acute and chronic complications. Although described more than a century ago, challenges in comprehensive disease management and collaborative research on this disease are compounded by the complex molecular and clinical phenotypes of SCD, environmental and psychosocial factors, limited therapeutic options and ambiguous terminology. This ambiguous terminology has hampered the integration and interoperability of existing SCD knowledge, and SCD research translation. The SCD Ontology (SCDO), which is a community-driven integrative and universal knowledge representation system for SCD, overcomes this issue by providing a controlled vocabulary developed by a group of experts in both SCD and ontology design. SCDO is the first and most comprehensive standardized human- and machine-readable resource that unambiguously represents terminology and concepts about SCD for researchers, patients and clinicians. It is built around the central concept ‘hemoglobinopathy’, allowing inclusion of non-SCD haemoglobinopathies, such as thalassaemias, which may interfere with or influence SCD phenotypic manifestations. This collaboratively developed ontology constitutes a comprehensive knowledge management system and standardized terminology of various SCD-related factors. The SCDO will promote interoperability of different research datasets, facilitate seamless data sharing and collaborations, including meta-analyses within the SCD community, and support the development and curation of data-basing and clinical informatics in SCD." xsd:string

Known causes include the following: Diabetes Mellitus, Excessive use of alcohol, Nutritional deficiencies (such as thiamin deficiency), an uncommon cause in the United States, except among alcoholics who are malnourished, Vitamin B12 deficiency, which causes subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord (see Subacute Combined Degeneration) and often pernicious anemia (see Inadequate absorption), An underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), Toxic substances, including heavy metals such as lead and mercury, Kidney failure, Certain cancers, such as lung cancer, Rarely, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) taken in excessive amounts." xsd:string
property_value: SCDO:0000662 "Acute polyneuropathy (as occurs in Guillain-Barré syndrome) begins suddenly in both legs and progresses rapidly upward to the arms. Symptoms include weakness and a pins-and-needles sensation or loss of sensation. The muscles that control breathing may be affected, resulting in respiratory failure.In the most common form of chronic polyneuropathy, only sensation is affected. Usually, the feet are affected first, but sometimes the hands are. A pins-and-needles sensation, numbness, burning pain, and loss of vibration sense and position sense (knowing where the arms and legs are) are prominent symptoms. Because position sense is lost, walking and even standing become unsteady. Consequently, muscles may not be used. Eventually, they may weaken and waste away. Then, muscles may become stiff and permanently shortened (called contractures). Diabetic neuropathy commonly causes painful tingling or burning sensations in the hands and feet-a condition called distal polyneuropathy. Pain is often worse at night and may be aggravated by touch or by a change in temperature. People may lose the senses of temperature and pain, so they often burn themselves and may have open sores caused by prolonged pressure or other injuries. Without pain as a warning of too much stress, joints are susceptible to injuries. This type of injury is called neurogenic arthropathy (Charcot joints) Polyneuropathy often affects the nerves of the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary functions in the body (such as blood pressure, heart rate, digestion, salivation, and urination). Typical symptoms are constipation, sexual dysfunction, and fluctuating blood pressure-most notably a sudden fall in blood pressure when a person stands up (orthostatic hypotension). The skin may become pale and dry, and sweating may be reduced. Much less often, control of bowel movements or urination is lost, leading to fecal or urinary incontinence." xsd:string

Once the patient is in a horizontal position, blood flow to the brain is no longer hindered by gravitation and consciousness is regained. Unconsciousness usually lasts for seconds to minutes. Headache and drowsiness (which usually follow seizures) do not follow a syncopal attack. Syncope results from a sudden impairment of brain metabolism usually due to a reduction in cerebral blood flow." []

They are myeloid granulocytes and their names is derived from the fact that their cytoplasm contains granules that stain with acidic dye as well as granules that stain with basic dye. Their nuclei consist of three to five lobes connected by slender threads of chromatin. Mature neutrophils live for approximately one day.

comment: Roughly one-third of affected individuals can predict the onset of a migraine because it is preceded by an "aura," visual disturbances that appear as flashing lights, zig-zag lines or a temporary loss of vision. People with migraine tend to have recurring attacks triggered by a number of different factors, including stress, anxiety, hormonal changes, bright or flashing lights, lack of food or sleep, and dietary substances. Migraine in some women may relate to changes in hormones and hormonal levels during their menstrual cycle. For many years, scientists believed that migraines were linked to the dilation and constriction of blood vessels in the head. Investigators now believe that migraine has a genetic cause.

comment: Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a potentially life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia that presents as a wide QRS complex tachycardia, and is defined as three or more consecutive QRS complexes with a duration longer than 120 milliseconds (ms) and a rate of 100 beats per minute or more, whereby the complexes have a ventricular origin. VT can be subdivided as follows: (i) sustained VT persists for 30 seconds or more; (ii) non-sustained VT lasts less than 30 seconds; (iii) monomorphic VT displays a uniform QRS morphology; and (iv) polymorphic VT displays QRS morphologies that variy from beat to beat. VT is observed most commonly in individuals with structural heart disease or acute myocardial infarction (MI). VT may also be observed in in the setting of drug toxicity or electrolyte abnormalities or in individuals with Mendelian disease.

This often happens in the feet and legs. You may lose feeling in your legs and arms. Because of this, you may not notice when you step on something sharp. You may not notice when you touch something that is too hot or cold, like the water in a bathtub. You may not know when you have a small blister or sore on your feet. Numbness may make it harder to tell where your feet are moving and can cause a loss of balance. Muscle problems: Damage to the nerves can make it harder to control muscles. It can also cause weakness. You may notice problems moving a part of your body. You may fall because your legs buckle. You may trip over your toes. Doing tasks such as buttoning a shirt may be harder. You may also notice that your muscles twitch or cramp. Your muscles may become smaller. Problems with body organs: People with nerve damage may have problems digesting food. You may feel full or bloated and have heartburn after eating only a little food. Sometimes you may vomit food that has not been digested well. You may have either loose stools or hard stools. Some people have problems swallowing. Damage to the nerves to your heart may cause you to feel light-headed, or faint, when you stand up. Angina is the warning chest pain for heart disease and heart attack. Nerve damage may \"hide\" this warning sign. You should learn other warning signs of a heart attack. They are sudden fatigue, sweating, shortness of breath, nausea, and vomiting." xsd:string

def: "Inflammation of the myocardium." []
comment: Myocarditis can be caused by a variety of bacterial and viral infections. Enteroviruses, especially coxsackievirus B, are often associated with acute myocarditis. However, with the advent of genetic analysis, adenovirus and parvovirus B19 have also been found to be frequent causes of myocarditis. Exposure to drug treatment, physical stimuli such as radiation and heat, metabolic disorders, immune disorders, and pregnancy are also causes of myocarditis. Many cases of myocarditis are idiopathic. Myocarditis presents with non-specific symptoms including chest pain, dyspnoea, and palpitations, and thus often mimics more common disorders such as coronary artery disease. In some patients, cardiac MRI and endomyocardial biopsy can help identify myocarditis, predict risk of cardiovascular events, and guide treatment.

Upon administration, crizanlizumab binds to P-selectin and blocks its interaction with P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1; SELPLG) on neutrophils and monocytes. P-selectin, a glycoprotein that functions as a cell adhesion molecule (CAM), translocates to the surface of activated endothelial cells and platelets, upon stimulation, where it binds to its ligand and mediates the rolling of platelets and neutrophils on activated endothelial cells. Therefore, blockade of p-selectin may inhibit platelet aggregation, maintain blood flow and minimize sickle cell-related pain crises (SCPC)." []

The binding of voxelotor to HbS prevents HbS polymerization, reduces sickling, decreases red blood cell (RBC) damage and increases the half-life of RBCs. This improves blood flow and decreases hemolytic anemia." []

Binding of pregabalin to VDCC A2D subunits prevents calcium influx and the subsequent calcium-dependent release of various neurotransmitters, including glutamate, norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, and substance P, from the presynaptic nerve terminals of hyperexcited neurons; synaptic transmission is inhibited and neuronal excitability is diminished.

The Glasgow Coma Scale is a system of examining a comatose patient. It is helpful for evaluating the depth of the coma, tracking the patient's progress, and predicting (somewhat) the ultimate outcome of the coma. The Glasgow Coma Scale assigns a different number of points for exam results in three different categories: opening the eyes, verbal response (using words or voice to respond), and motor response (moving a part of the body). Fifteen is the largest possible number of total points, indicating the highest level of functioning. The highest level of functioning would be demonstrated by an individual who spontaneously opens his/her eyes, gives appropriate answers to questions about his/her situation, and can carry out a command (such as \"move your leg\" or \"nod your head\"). Three is the least possible number of total points and would be given to a patient for whom not even a painful stimulus is sufficient to provoke a response. In the middle are those patients who may be able to respond, but who require an intense or painful stimulus, and whose response may demonstrate some degree of brain malfunctioning (such as a person whose only response to pain in a limb is to bend that limb in toward the body). When performed as part of the admission examination, a Glasgow score of three to five points often suggests that the patient has likely suffered fatal brain damage, while eight or more points indicates that the patient's chances for recovery are good. Expansion of the pupils and respiratory pattern are also important. Metabolic causes of coma are diagnosed from blood work and urinalysis to evaluate blood chemistry, drug screen, and blood cell abnormalities that may indicate infection. Anatomic causes of coma are diagnosed from CT (computed tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans." xsd:string

name: Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY)
def: "One DALY can be thought of as one lost year of \"healthy\" life. The sum of these DALYs across the population, or the burden of disease, can be thought of as a measurement of the gap between current health status and an ideal health situation where the entire population lives to an advanced age, free of disease and disability." []
comment: Calculation: DALY = YLL + YLD - The YLL basically correspond to the number of deaths multiplied by the standard life expectancy at the age at which death occurs. The basic formula for YLL (without yet including other social preferences discussed below), is the following for a given cause, age and sex: YLL = N x L where: N = number of deaths L = standard life expectancy at age of death in years. Because YLL measure the incident stream of lost years of life due to deaths, an incidence perspective has also been taken for the calculation of YLD in the original Global Burden of Disease Study for year 1990 and in subsequent WHO updates for years 2000 to 2004. To estimate YLD for a particular cause in a particular time period, the number of incident cases in that period is multiplied by the average duration of the disease and a weight factor that reflects the severity of the disease on a scale from 0 (perfect health) to 1 (dead). The basic formula for YLD is the following (again, without applying social preferences): YLD = I x DW x L where: I = number of incident cases; DW = disability weight; L = average duration of the case until remission or death (years). Prevalence YLD - The recent GBD 2010 study published by IHME in December 2012 used an updated life expectancy standard for the calculation of YLL and based the YLD calculation on prevalence rather than incidence: YLD = P x DW where: P = number of prevalent cases; DW = disability weight.

It is therefore sensitive to short-term psychiatric disorders but not to long-standing attributes of the respondent. The self-administered questionnaire focuses on two major areas: inability to carry out normal functions; appearance of new and distressing phenomena. It is available in the following versions: GHQ-60 -- the fully detailed 60-item questionnaire; GHQ-30 -- a short form without items relating to physical illness; GHQ-28 -- a 28 item scaled version -- assesses somatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia, social dysfunction and severe depression; GHQ-12 -- quick, reliable and sensitive short form, ideal for research studies."

Many variants of G6PD, mostly produced from missense mutations, have been described with wide ranging levels of enzyme activity and associated clinical symptoms. G6PD deficiency may cause neonatal jaundice, acute hemolysis, or severe chronic non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene."

The questionnaire wording can be adapted to the specific illness by replacing the word illness with the name of the condition. For the identity subscale, respondents are asked if they have experienced a number of symptoms since their illness, and if they feel the symptoms are related to their current illness. Response is by circling 'yes' or 'no' to each question. Responses are then summed to give an overall score. For the causal subscale, respondents are asked what they perceive to be the cause of their illness and are asked to respond to each of the listed causes using a 5-point Likert style scale, ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Respondents are also asked to rank the 3 most important factors believed to be the cause of their illness. The third section (7 subscales) is scored by summing responses to each item is on a 5-point Likert style scale, ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. All items for each of the subscales are summed to give an overall score. High scores on the identity, consequences, timeline acute/chronic and cyclical subscales represent strongly held beliefs about the number of symptoms attributed, the negative consequences, and the chronicity and cyclical nature of the illness. High scores on the personal and treatment control and coherence subscales represent positive beliefs about controllability and a personal understanding of the illness." []

These were: Internal Health Locus of Control (IHLC), Powerful Others Health Locus of Control (PHLC) and Chance Health Locus of Control (CHLC). Subsequently, a fourth subscale, the God Locus of Health Control (G LHC) scale was developed to assess the extent of an individual's belief that God controls his or her health status was added to the measure. Thus, the expanded MHLC Consists of 4 sub-scales: one Internal and 3 external subscales namely, powerful others, chance and God. Each of the 4 sub-scales has 6 items making a total of 24 items. The two original versions of the MHLC (forms A & B) deal with the general health status whereas the third version (Form C) assesses control-related cognitions about a specific disease state." []

def: "QALYs are used primarily to correct a person's life expectancy based on the levels of health-related quality of life they are predicted to experience throughout the course of their life, or part of it." []
comment: The number of QALYs lived by an individual in one year is simply: QALYs lived in one year = 1 * Q with Q <= 1; where Q is the health-related quality of life weight attached to the relevant year of life. I.e. QALY assumes a utility value (quality of life) of 1 = perfect health and a utility value of 0 = dead: Years of Life x Utility Value = Number of QALYs. E.g. If a person lives in perfect health for one year, that person will have 1 QALY (1 Year of Life x 1 Utility Value = 1 QALY), If a person lives in perfect health but only for half a year, that person will have 0.5 QALYs (0.5 Years of Life x 1 Utility Value = 0.5 QALYs) OR if a person lives for 1 year in a situation with 0.5 utility (half of perfect health), that person will also have 0.5 QALYs (1 Year of Life x 0.5 Utility Value = 0.5 QALYs). In cost-effectiveness evaluations the QALY is used to quantify the effectiveness of, for instance, a new medication versus the current one. In other words, the current standard of care is taken as the baseline, and the QALYs gained from the new (improved) intervention are counted in addition.

The passages on the S-TOFHLA use a modified Cloze procedure where every fifth to seventh word is omitted and subjects select the correct word from among a set of four options. The passages contain information about an upper gastrointestinal tract x-ray procedure, and the \"Rights and Responsibilities\" section from a Medicaid application, and have Gunning-Fox readability indices of fourth and tenth grade, respectively. In early developmental studies, the reading comprehension passages in the S-TOFHLA had a reliability coefficient (Cronbach's alpha) of 0.97 and correlation with the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) of 0.81. Each selection is scored a \"1\" for correct or a \"0\" for incorrect and scores are summed over items to create a total score. The 36-point scale of the S-TOFHLA is divided into three categories of functional literacy: inadequate (0-16), adequate (17-22) and functional (23-36)." []

def: "A bioassay to measure urine concentration of albumin, which is produced by the liver and is the most abundant protein in the blood." []
comment: In the protocol provided, albumin concentration is measured according to a fluorescent immunoassay (FIA). The protocol also lists reference ranges for healthy adults.\n\nThe criteria for clinically significant proteinuria have been changed from an albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 30 mg/mmol or more to 3 mg/mmol or more. This is because there is evidence that the risk of adverse outcomes is a continuum and starts at an ACR well below 30 mg/mmol.\n\nThe Sickle Cell Disease Research and Scientific Panel notes that the terms "microalbuminuria" and "macroalbuminuria" have been used clinically to describe different levels of abnormal albumin excretion rate: 30-299 mg/g urine creatinine, and >300 mg/gr urine creatinine, for microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria, respectively. Recently, a new terminology has been proposed: "low level albuminuria" instead of microalbuminuia, and "high level albuminuria" for macroalbuminuria, since the older terminology could be interpreted as measuring different molecular forms of albumin. \n\nBecause albuminuria may be affected by non-pathological factors (exercise, menstruation contamination, biological variability, etc.), abnormal values should be confirmed within 1-2 months.

comment: Often these individuals have co-inherited another hemoglobin mutation that decreases hemoglobin solubility (eg, HbS-Antilles; Hb-Quebec-Chori; HbS-Oman; Hb Jamaica Plain).\n\nOther rare causes of symptomatic sickle cell trait include: mosaicism for cells in which only the sickle mutation was expressed due to post-zygotic uniparental disomy, and when sickle cell trait coexists with pyruvate kinase deficiency, which lowers the hemoglobin oxygen affinity, resulting in hemoglobin S polymerization and sickling.

comment: If a person tests “positive,” then further testing is needed to determine if this is a new “acute” infection or a “chronic” hepatitis B infection. \n\nA positive HBsAg test result means that you are infected and can spread the hepatitis B virus to others through your blood.

comment: A "positive" or "reactive" anti-HBc (or HBcAb) test result indicates a past or current hepatitis B infection. \n\nThe core antibody does not provide any protection against the hepatitis B virus (unlike the surface antibod). This test can only be fully understood by knowing the results of the HBsAg and anti-HBs tests.\n\nA positive anti-HBc (or HBcAb) test result requires talking to your health care provider for a complete explanation of your hepatitis B status.

Usually red blood cells are a standard size of about 6-8 μm in diameter. Certain disorders, however, cause a significant variation in cell size. Higher RDW values indicate greater variation in size. Normal reference range of RDW-CV in human red blood cells is 11.5-14.5%.[1] If anemia is observed, RDW test results are often used together with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) results to determine the possible causes of the anemia. It is mainly used to differentiate an anemia of mixed causes from an anemia of a single cause." []

It has a frequency of about 1 in 5,000 African Americans, but has been reported in other ethnic groups in the Mediterranean region as well, HbG Phil itself has no clinical consequences. The only finding of clinical interest is the mild microcytosis. While this molecule has no clinical consequences, the presence helps to distinguish HbG from HbD that shares its electrophoretic migration on HPLC and gel electrophoresis and which does have consequences when it occurs with sickle trait."
